# Chromex Examples

Here we maintain example projects suitable for learning or starting your own extensions:

* [lein](lein) - a Leiningen based project with Figwheel support
* [shadow](shadow) - a shadow-cljs based project with deps.edn

Note that [_shared](_shared) contains shared sources between projects - we symlink them into individual projects.

Here are community projects which might be useful:

* [noitcudni/chromex-template](https://github.com/noitcudni/chromex-template) - a lein based chromex project template
* [omnyway-labs/chromex-shadow-template](https://github.com/omnyway-labs/chromex-shadow-template) - a shadow-cljs based 
project template
